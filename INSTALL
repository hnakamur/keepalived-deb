FIB_RULES if static or dynamic rules are specified

Installing from a git repo
==========================
To install from a git repo, execute:

  1. Ensure you have autoconf and automake installed

  2. git clone https://github.com/acassen/keepalived.git

  3. cd keepalived

  4. ./autogen.sh	# generate the autoconf and automake environment

  5. Follow the instructions below for Installation, omitting the first two steps.

Installation
============

  1. tar -xf TARFILE

  2. cd into the directory

  3. './configure [BUILD_OPTIONS]'

  4. 'make'

  5. 'make install'. This will install keepalived on your system,
     binaries and configuration filei etc. The location the files are
     install to will depend on the configure options used :
     * keepalived : The keepalived daemon program.
     * genhash    : The MD5 url digest generator. You need it to
                    configure HTTP GET check and SSL GET check in
                    order to compute MD5SUM digest etalon.
     * /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
     * /etc/keepalived/samples/*
     * man pages
     * /usr/share/snmp/mibs/{KEEPALIVED,VRRP,VRRPv3}-MIB.txt if SNMP is enabled
     * /usr/lib/systemd/system/keepalived.service if using systemd
     * If keepalived is built with DBus support:
	/etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.keepalived.Vrrp1.conf
	/usr/share/dbus-1/interfaces/org.keepalived.Vrrp1.{Instance,Vrrp}.xml

  6. If you are using systemd, to enable the keepalived execute:
	systemctl enable keepalived

     If you are using an init, link keepalived.init into your runlevel directory.
     On Red Hat systems :
     ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/keepalived.init /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S99keepalived

  By default the configure script uses /usr/local as base directory. You can
  change this value to your own by passing it the --prefix value.

  eg: './configure --prefix=/usr/'
      run './configure --help' to see all options.

Building RPM files
==================

 If building from tarball:
  1a. tar -xf TARFILE
  1b. cd into the directory

 If building from git clone:
  1. ./build_setup 

 For tarball and git
  2. ./configure
  3. make rpm

 The .rpm files will be created in directory `rpm --eval "%{_rpmdir}"`/ARCH

Modifying source code
=====================

If you modify the source code, especially configure.ac or any Makefile.am
file, you will need to regenerate the build files. Keepalived uses automake
and so you will need to have automake and autoconf installed.

Configuration
=============

  Just take a look at the /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf file installed.
  It will give you all the information needed. Alternativley, run
  'man keepalived.conf' or look at doc/keepalived.conf.SYNOPSIS.
  If you want more information about keepalived, please refer to the
  keepalived homepage into the documentation section.

Creating a docker container
===========================
The simplest way to build a docker image is to execute the following
commands:

./configure OPTIONS
make
make docker


Alternatively there is a very useful github project that was maintained
by osixia for building a docker container with keepalived.

To use, run the following:
git clone https://github.com/osixia/docker-keepalived.git
cd docker-keepalived
make build
docker run --name keepalived --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --net=host \
  --env KEEPALIVED_INTERFACE=eth0 -d osixia/keepalived:1.3.5 \
	# or whatever version of keepalived you have

To update the keepalived source code, put a new tarball in the image
directory (the Dockerfile may need updating with a new version).

Useful docker commands are:
docker logs keepalived 2>&1 | less	# view system logs of container
docker exec -it keepalived bash		# execute shell in container
docker rm -f keepalived			# Remove the container

keepalived is unable to load the ip_tables, ip6_tables, xt_set and ip_vs
modules from within the container, so ensure they are already loaded in
the host system.

To generate a core file in the root filesystem of the container,
/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern needs to be updated in the host system,
and not from the container (or in other words the -M option to keepalived
does not work within a container. Installing gdb in the container (edit
the image/Dockerfile to add it before make build) may be helpful if you
need to examine core files in the container.


Running in an AWS container
===========================
The VRRP protocol is not enabled in AWS security groups. If you are using AWS,
create a rule in the AWS security group. The rule should be "Custom Protocol"
and value should be "112" (the VRRP protocol number). All ports should be opened.


Running with SELinux
====================
If the system running keepalived has SELinux enabled in enforcing mode, keepalived
may have difficulty running scripts, accessing configuration files, etc, especially
if keepalived is being started by systemd.

By default, scripts should be located in /usr/libexec/keepalived, or alternatively,
to set the necessary security context for a script, execute:
chcon -t keepalived_unconfined_script_exec_t PATH_TO_SCRIPT

See
   https://www.mankier.com/8/keepalived_selinux and
   https://www.mankier.com/8/keepalived_unconfined_script_selinux
for further details of SElinux and keepalived.


Have fun with it !
